// https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths/
// What I have done here is created a vector of map in which I am storing occurences of each character in a map of a particular word.
// Then I am checking for each word whether any letter is repeated in any two words or not, if not then I keep max val of 
// the length (i) * length(j)
// Time Complexity - O(n^2) Space Complexity - O(26*n)

// Time Complexity theoritically same, but practically would be less due to bit manipulation, similarly space will also be less practically
// This bit manipulation approach hit me when i read the tag bit manipulation ðŸ˜…
// What I have done here is that I can store every number in bits. i.e. if a is occuring i can represent it with 1
// if b is occuring i can represent it with 10, if c is occuring i can represent it with 100, similarly for all characters.
// Now if I do bitwise and between them and if no character is same then and will definitely be zero. Then I will calculate
// the max answer by multiplying indexes at that positions.
// Time Complexity - O(n^2) Space Complexity - O(n)
